# Hermit

Hermit is a monospace font designed to be clear, pragmatic and very readable. Its creation has been focused on programming. Every glyph was carefully planned and calculated, according to defined principles and rules. For this reason, Hermit is coherent and regular.

Symbols stand out from common text. Dots and commas are easily seen, and operators are clear even when not surrounded by spaces. Similar characters have been designed to be very distinguishable from each other.
